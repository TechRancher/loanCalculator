# loanCalculator

This is a Loan Calculator I built to work on my JavaScript programming.
In this app I used bootstrap to build the UI
I wrote JavaScript to mix with bootstrap to make the UX better by adding a reset button and hide results section.


Feel free to check it out.  
Let me know if you find any problems with it. I would be interested in learning what others think.
